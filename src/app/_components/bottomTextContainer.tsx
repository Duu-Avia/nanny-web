          Families who use our services look for people already trained, qualified, experienced, and with excellent references, which is why we are very demanding in terms of our recruitment process and candidates’ references.
        </p>

        <p>
          First of all, it is important for our consultants to have a clear understanding of the family’s needs and environment. Such information is normally included in the detailed description of the job and desired profile.
        </p>

        <p>
          Based on this initial assessment, we will <strong>advise the family to employ either a monolingual, bilingual or trilingual nanny, a travelling governess, a tutor specialising in the education of young children, or a maternity nurse who will help with a new-born child.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          We customise our recruitment every day and introduce only those candidates who perfectly meet the expectations of each family.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our strength derives from our methods of recruitment and interviewing process during which we pay particular attention to getting to know our candidates. <strong>Each candidate is thoroughly interviewed by one of our consultants.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          We create a profile folder which includes copies of all diplomas, certificates and <strong>professional references from previous employers of the candidate</strong>. With its broad experience in recruitment and placement, Morgan & Mallet Nannies conducts full background check and what is required from the candidates a folder consisting of criminal record certificates plus all the relevant documents to which prove candidates professional skills within the childcare industry.
        </p>

        <p>
          All candidates must have a minimum of three years experience in childcare if they want to apply and have their profile pre-screened by the agency’s consultants.
